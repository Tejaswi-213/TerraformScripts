#providers what is the importnce of this #
#####################if you you don't provide provider at the initial of th script how can the resource be created on the cloud###########
#if you want to configure for a different cloud provider then you can go to terraform.in doucmentation to know more about this##
# if you have to use multi region or create infrastructure on hybrid cloud how? ##
# you write something like ##

provider "aws" {
  alias = "us-east-1" # this alias can be anything no need to be just the region it can be anything
  region = "us-east-1"
}
provider "aws" {
  alias = "us-west-2" # this alias can be anything no need to be just the region it can be anything
  region = "us-west-2"
}
resource "aws_instance" "example-123" {
   ami = "ami-0256486745754"
   instance_type = "t2_micro"
   provider = "us-east-1" #here you have to give the alias name so that while creating the resource it is going to look for the alias
}
resource "aws_instance" {
   ami = "ami-0123654778945"
   instance_type = "t2_micro"
   provider = "us-west-2" #here you have to give the alias name so that while creating the resource it is going to look for the alias
}
   
# now hybrid providers how do we write the scripts ##
# azure have the different service principle or mechanish so we need to provide all the id's like below

provider "aws" {
   region = "us-east-1"
}

provider "azurerm" {
  subscription_id = "your-azure-client-id"
  client_id = "your-azure-client-id"
  client_secret = "your-azure-client-secret"
  tenant_id = "your-azure-tenant-id"
}

#now how to create the resources on hybrid cloud
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
   ami = "ami-45674wd4654"
   instance_type = "t2.micro"
}

resource "azurerm_virtual_machine" "example" {
   name = "example-vm"
   location = "eastus"
   size = "Standard_A1"
}

#please learn the requirements in the creation no needs of id's we can follow the documentation
############Now we start with variables##########
# variables are helpful with out hardcoding the values in the script ##
#2 tyes of variables input variables and output variables#
variable.tf

variable "instance_type" {
   description = "EC2 instance type" # you can avoid description if you want not mandatory thing
   type        = string # very important
   default     = "t2.micro"
}

#define ami id here
variable "ami_id {
  description = "EC2 AMI ID"
  type        =  string
}

# Configure the AWS provder using the input variables
provider "aws" {
  region       = "us-east-1"
}

# creating ec2 now using variables##
resource "aws_instance_id" "example" {
  ami           = var.ami_id
  instance_type = var.instance_type
}

# we are looking for the output as well example like public ip
output "public_ip"
  description = "Public IP address of the EC2 instance"
  value       = aws_instance.example_instance.public_ip

# tf vars is used to put the value
